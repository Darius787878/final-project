    <p class="second">the Darkin Blade</p>
    <p class="first">Atrox</p>
    <p>Aatrox was once a mighty and revered warrior among the Darkin, a group of powerful beings who were created by the celestial forces of the universe to wage war against the Void. The Darkin were initially seen as saviors, but their insatiable hunger for power and conquest led to their corruption and eventual downfall.
        
        During the Darkin War, Aatrox was a formidable general, wielding immense power and strength. However, his insatiable thirst for battle and destruction contributed to the Darkin’s eventual defeat. As the conflict raged on, the Darkin were ultimately betrayed by their own power. They were cursed and imprisoned in weapons, their true forms bound by these cursed artifacts.
        
        Aatrox was imprisoned within his own massive sword, which was crafted to contain his dark essence. Over time, the sword became known as a cursed relic, and Aatrox’s rage and desire for vengeance grew. As he struggled to escape his imprisonment, his mind and spirit were twisted by the curse, turning him into a vessel of relentless hatred and destruction.
